# Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is a **strongly typed** programming language that builds on JavaScript.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and refactoring
- **Scalability**: Easier to maintain large codebases

## Quick Example

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript makes JavaScript development more **predictable** and **maintainable**.
