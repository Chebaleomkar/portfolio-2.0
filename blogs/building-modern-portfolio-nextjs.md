# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js

Creating a portfolio that stands out requires more than just good design - it needs to be **performant**, **accessible**, and **maintainable**.

## The Tech Stack

For this portfolio, I chose:

- **Next.js 14** - For server components and the App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** - For utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Markdown** - For content management

## Key Features

### 1. Clean Design

The design philosophy focuses on:
- Minimal visual noise
- High contrast for readability
- Subtle animations that don't distract

### 2. Performance First

Every choice was made with performance in mind:
- Server-side rendering for fast initial loads
- Optimized images and fonts
- Minimal JavaScript bundle

### 3. Easy Content Management

Blog posts are stored as Markdown files with frontmatter, making it easy to:
- Write content in any editor
- Version control with Git
- Deploy without a CMS

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio is an ongoing process. The key is to start simple and iterate based on what matters most to you.
